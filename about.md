###### Welcome to Proggram

Every developer, designer, and those works with software comes up with practical solutions to their problems. ProgGram aims to combine these solutions&tips together to help others. Spend less time on how to do it and more time on what to do!

I will be posting some solutions I came up with while working on some projects, and those will be mostly on Ruby language. I will share some code snippets and explain how it helped me to solve some problems. Those may not be the best solution to the problems, and I would be more than happy if i get some feedback from anyone to make it better.

This does not mean that this platform will only contain programming related things, I am open to accept pull requests about design tips, software recommendations, shortcuts, OS level information and so on. I will try to accept a wide range of topics as long as I think it has the potential to help others.
