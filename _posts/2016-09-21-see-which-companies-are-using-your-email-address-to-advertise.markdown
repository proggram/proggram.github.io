I recently stumbled upon a page on my Facebook profile while checking my settings.

Apparently, Facebook lets you know which companies have uploaded your email address to their system in order to create a custom audience to advertise. I am pretty sure Facebook is not the only platform they are using to target me as a consumer. While It is not a big issue, or a deal breaker, it still left a sour taste in my mouth.

If you want to see how it looks for you, you can click on this link and scroll to bottom of the page.

[https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/](https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/){:target="_blank"}

It should look something like this.

Facebook gives you the option to hide ads from each one of them if you will, which is not bad i guess.

You can read more about their Custom Audience thing [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/341425252616329){:target="_blank"}


Cheers!
