Latest Mac OS version, Sierra comes with a neat feature on Safari which will let you pop out youtube videos to its own player.

This will let you have a small player on your screen while you can go surf on other websites or use other applications.

Currently, it requires you to right click on a youtube video 2 times (yes, you heard it right) in order to see the "Enter Picture-in-Picture" option. It will look like this.

When you click on that link, video will detach from youtube to its own player on your screen which you can also drag and drop into any part of the screen. Hovering over the player will show video controls as well so you can pause/play and resize the player.

As far as I know, this is only available on Safari browsers, and can be used on Youtube, Vimeo and Itunes already. More and more website will be using this on upcoming days i would guess.


Maybe not a lifesaver but a good-to-know information :tv:
